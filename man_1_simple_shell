.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a version of a simple shell that utilizes a built UNIX command line interpreter that is able to handle command lines with arguments, execute commands found in the PATH as well as preforms the built-ins exit and env. All input in obtained from stdin and written to stdout.

.br
--- Here are the more commonly utilized executables found in the PATH and their usages:
.LS

\fB ls \fR        Lists the folder and file names in the current working directory.

.br
\fB cat \fR       Concatenates and print files.

.br
\fB head \fR      Displays first 10 (default) lines of specified file.

.br
\fB tail \fR      Displays last 10 (default) lines of specified file.

.br
\fB pwd \fR       Displays PATH of present working directory.

.br
\fB echo \fR      Outputs to stdout the strings that are passed in stdin.

.br
\fB cp \fR        Copies specified file into existing specified file or creates new if currently
            non-existent.

.br
\fB mkdir \fR     Creates directory.

.br
\fB rm \fR        Removes files and folders.

.br
\fB touch \fR     Used to create an empty file; can also \fB touch \fR a file or folder to update access
            or modification date without opening, saving or closing it.

.br
\fB chmod \fR     Allows user to set permissions for read, write and execute for the user, members
            of your group and others.

.br
\fB mv \fR        Moves a file(s) and/or folder(s) to second argument location.

.br
--- Here are the two built-ins available for use in this simple_shell:
.br

\fB env \fR       Utilized to either used to either print a list of environment variables or run another utility in an
            altered environment without having to modify the currently existing environment.

.br
\fB exit \fR      Allows for natural process termination; used to close simple_shell.

.br
.B --- PLEASE NOTE ---
Manual pages are available for all of the previously provided PATH system commands and two operable built-ins and contain more details regarding their usage, format and flags that will work in conjunction with these commands in order to execute the users desired outcome properly. Please \fI man (command) \fR for further information.
